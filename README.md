## statement of problem
what is the boolean value of the statement "it is possible to get from the starting position to the treasure"?

## recursive abstraction
when I am asked to
     determine the boolean value of the statement
     "it is possible to get from the starting position to the treasure."
the recursive abstraction can
     determine the boolean value of the statement
     "it is possible to get from a position with one less choice to the treasure."

note: a choice is made at a position with a turn
  

## base case
a straight path to treasure
